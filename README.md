# AtomEngine
A simple game engine that I am making just for learning and fun

To do:

<ul>
	<li>Make a 2D physics API
	<li>Design a consistent and good API
	<li>Make a 2D light API (almost done)
	<li>Multithreading for audio and maybe for Entities
	<li>Fix bugs (if any) and UI
	<li>Store the aspect ratio somewhere to use it
	<li>Improve the input API
	<li>Implement Box2D's debug draws
	<li>Make DrawLine, DrawRect, DrawEllipse functions
	<li>3D rendering ;)
	<li>Networking (maybe)
	<li>Port to other platforms
	<li>Native windowing
<ul/>
